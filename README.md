# Welcome to Blue-Block [GER]!
##A small Java game for breaks in school.
This version is a mix of German and English.

From 1 to 5 players.
The game has no `Internet-Multiplayer` function.

This game has the layout "One Cell = One Color" which means, players etc. have only 1 Color.

_have fun!!_

## you need Eclipse to run the game.
#### Last updated with 'Eclipse Neon`.
I hope every computer has this ^^.

## Please notice
This game isn't the best, it's one of my first (and best) projects and has many problems.

I'm available for solutions :).
###Play as Block:
 You have to survive from the mouse (our biggest enemy!) and from the other players (when they run over you, you're dead).
###Play as Mouse:
 Klick on the fields to create different Types of Dangerous things!
 F.e. lava and sourness.
