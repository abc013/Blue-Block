## A small Java game for breaks in school written without graphics library.
From 1 to 5 players on one PC.

This game has the layout "One Cell = One Color" which means that every tile and player is represented as a single, colored cell.

_have fun!!_

#### Last updated with 'Eclipse Neon'.
For portability, export the project as .jar and run it via command line:

## Please notice
This game isn't the best, it's one of my first projects and has many problems.

I'm available for solutions :).
### Play as Block:
 You have to survive from the mouse (our biggest enemy!) and from the other players (when they run over you, you're dead, this can be disabled though).
### Play as Mouse:
 Klick on the fields to create different Types of Dangerous things!
 F.e. lava and sourness.
