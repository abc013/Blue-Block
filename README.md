# Welcome to Blue-Block [GER]!
##A small Java game for breaks in school.
This version is a mix of German and English.

From 1 to 5 players.
The game has no `Internet-Multiplayer` function.

This game has the layout "One Cell = One Color" which means, players etc. have only 1 Color.

_have fun!!_

## you need Eclipse to run the game.
#### Last updated with 'Eclipse Neon`.
I hope every computer has this ^^.

## Please notice
This game isn't the best, it's one of my first (and best) projects and has many problems.

I'm available for solutions :).
###Play as Block:
 You have to survive from the mouse (our biggest enemy!) and from the other players (when they run over you, you're dead).

 Klick on the fields to create different Types of Dangerous things!
 F.e. lava and acid.
